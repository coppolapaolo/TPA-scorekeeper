# TPA Scorekeeper

Welcome to the "TPA Scorekeeper" app, a web-based tool designed to help players and enthusiasts keep track of scores during a 9-ball pool game using the Total Performance Average (TPA) rating method. This app allows you to input player names, mark balls pocketed, note errors committed, and manage multiple innings, ultimately providing a comprehensive TPA scoresheet and final score summary at the end of the match.

## Features

- **Player Name Entry**: Input names for the two players at the start of the game.
- **Score Tracking**: Mark the number of balls pocketed and errors made for each player. 
- **Error Logging**: Follows the official TPA notation for all possible errors, ensuring accurate scorekeeping.
- **Match Summary**: Provides a detailed TPA scoresheet and final scoring, including balls pocketed, errors committed, TPA score, and racks won, updated in real-time throughout the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for smartphones but compatible with any modern browser that supports JavaScript.

## System Requirements

The app is built with Bootstrap 5.3.2 and jQuery 3.6.0, ensuring compatibility across all modern browsers with JavaScript enabled. It is designed for smartphone use but functions seamlessly on desktop browsers as well.

## Accessing the App

TPA Scorekeeper is readily accessible at [https://www.coppolapaolo.it/tpa.html](https://www.coppolapaolo.it/tpa.html). The app uses cookies to remember player names for convenience. It can also be run locally or installed on any server for personal use.

## How to Use

1. Start by entering the player names and clicking the 'Start' button.
2. Use the player name buttons to toggle between players. The active player is highlighted.
3. Begin each player's turn by noting the number of balls pocketed. For break shots, include both the balls pocketed on the break and the total for the turn.
4. Log any errors or fouls as per TPA terminology next.
5. Switch to the other player by pressing the player button. If the button isn't enabled, it means the entry doesn't comply with TPA rules.
6. Press the 'G' button to indicate a game win (when the 9-ball is pocketed).
7. The ongoing score is displayed below the players' names, showing pocketed balls, errors, TPA score, and racks won in real-time.
